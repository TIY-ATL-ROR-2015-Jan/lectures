## Welcome Back

I'm glad to be here and out of bed.

Sorry we missed a day of lecture and had
not my best written assignment. Hope the
notes on Friday helped.

## Let's Talk about the Weekend Assignment!

What did we have trouble with?

Would anyone like to present on:

0. Board Representation
1. How to enforce taking turns in a Rails app
2. How to start/join games.
3. The Win condition checking. (esp diagonals)
4. Legal moves / Making pieces fall to the bottom ...


## Don't Panic

Last week was great prep for the pieces
of this we were missing:

* Authentication
* Working collaboratively with Git
* Modeling a board game as a Web App

(And checking the win conditions is way
 simpler in checkers than in Connect 4.)

## Homework

Get your connect4 apps running on heroku!
(Even if they are incomplete.)
