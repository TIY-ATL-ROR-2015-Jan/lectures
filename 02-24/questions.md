## Homework

Continue your homework from [yesterday][questions-p1].

The original way suggested that you "Add a way for users to suggest songs that pulls track info from spotify."

I am amending that slightly. You should get two things done tonight:

* Add bootstrap and do some light styling of your site.
* Add a migration/model for proposed songs based on what we discussed in class.

It is encouraged for you to also try to define a controller, routes, and views to:

* Give the user a search form.
* On submitting the form, send them to a page populated with track results from `rspotify`.
* Clicking on a result creates an instance of your proposed song model and saves it in the database.

We'll discuss a good way to do this in class tomorrow (whether on campus or remote).
