## Prelude

1. Let's take a minute to not take programming so seriously.
   And remember that if anyone *ever* says you aren't a real programmer, they can go fuck themselves.
   If getting this stuff to work is meaningful to you and you're enjoying it, that's good enough.
2. Shout-outs to ModelViewCulture calling tech on its bullshit.
   Especially see: https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-code-school-industrial-complex
   I'm super open to private discussions (in person or email) with *any* of you
   if you have feedback on issues we can improve on. (other than wifi, duh.)
3. Programming can be funny sometimes. Let's take 5 to watch [Wat][wat].

## Part 1: Homework Review / Questions

A clever way to write top_months ... wound up being trickier than I thought.

Lessons:

* Sometimes dropping down to use specific SQL functions is good.
* Relations do this lazy chaining thing! Only certain methods are "kickers".
  At least: first, last, count

## Part 2: Tags but done right!

(Ya'll love serialize, right?)

Add a tag && tagging model and migration to remove the "serialized" tags.
Show the new query. WAY MO BETTA!

## Part 3: Show me the SQL!

Guess what .... (.to_sql)

# HW

* Read ActiveRecord Querying guide sections 13, 14, 19, 20
* TODO LIST APP! (questions.md soon to follow)
