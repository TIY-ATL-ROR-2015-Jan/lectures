## Some Final BetterBlog AJAX Goodness

* Let's pick one of Comment Deletion
  or Comment Editing and try to work
  through it in class together.
  Maybe both? Deletion first?

* What do we need?

## Relative Elements

* Parents
* Closest
* Siblings
* Children

## Insertion and Removal

* We've seen append for insertion and empty for removal.
* What else?

## The Smorgasborg

* .val for getting and setting
* show/hide/fadeIn/fadeOut

## Form Submission, Something on Double Click?

* Talk about Keypresses and Keycodes
* Bind to those event handlers
* Double Click event

## A Discussion of This

* jQuery makes it better, at least for event handlers.
  (i.e. most of what we care about.)
